# durakBot
A Machine learning algorithm we are training to learn to play the card game Durak.

Durak is a Russian card game that lies somewhere between euchre and war.
The objective of the game is to win by running out of cards, much like war. However,
the game is also played with alternating turns that have attacks and defenses 
where rank, suit, and the trump (dank) suit dictate strategy. This project
originally started as a joke when I couldn't beat my roommate at Durak, so I told him
I would build a bot that could beat him.

## Usage
From src directory:
```bash
python neat_run.py
```

To load restore file neat-checkpoint-N from the restore directory:
